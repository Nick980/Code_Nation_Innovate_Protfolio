    <h3>Gaming</h3>
        <p> Gaming is my favorite hobby, it helps me unwind and forget about the world around me for awhile. The game I play this most is World of    Warcraft, I've been playing this for over 15 years and have spent way too much time on it but I have made friends along the way and it has helped me and my brother bond over the years.
        Growing up I loved playing RTS games like Dune 2, Warcraft 1, 2, & 3 and Command and Conquer, as an adult I've fallen in love with Stellaris and have admittedly lost entire days at a time to this game, I am eagerly awaiting the next expansion pack for it releasing later this month. 
        Below is a list of my favorite games I've played in the last year.

    <h3>3D Printing</h3>
        <p>3D printing is another hobby of mine, I love designing my own print and printing other peoples prints from <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com" target="_blank">thingiverse.com</a>. Currently I am working on creating a power meter reading device based on the Home Assistant Glow project to help monitor my power consumption due to the increasing costs.</p>
